          <p><strong>Serverless Architecture for Developers &ndash; Shekhar Gulati (Xebia)</strong></p>
          <p>Serverless is an overloaded word. It means different things depending on the context. This session focuses on how Serverless compute enables us to build applications that are scalable, fault-tolerant, and event-driven. Serverless applications tend to be composed of small services aka Microservices. Thus, giving you all the benefits of Microservices.</p>
          <p>Serverless architecture is gaining traction for building applications that are spiky and demand driven in nature, especially in building data processing pipelines, social campaigns, IoT backend, WebHook backend, etc.  This session will start with an introduction to Serverless architecture and its core tenets. After setting the stage, we will look at AWS Lambda.</p><p>Lastly, we will look at how we built a Serverless application to automate the coding interview rounds in our organization. We will discuss the architecture and design strategies associated with building and delivering applications in a Serverless way. </p>

          <p><strong>Introduction to Azure AI &ndash; Brijraj Singh (Microsoft)</strong></p>
          <p> Everyone is talking about AI. The world of application programming is changing for the good with the advent of new AI services in the cloud. Implementing AI isn’t a complex science any more, reserved for scientists. We have made it simple with Azure, So simple that anyone who writes code can use it. During this session we’ll discuss the Azure cognitive services and understand how to introduce AI capabilities in your solutions.</p>

          <p><strong>Journey from COMX to AWS for Periscope Applications &ndash; Kiran Pratap (Thoughtworks)</strong></p>
          <p>In this talk, we will be covering the migration of applications of Periscope Suite from COMX to AWS. This talk will cover various choices made:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Security &amp; Client Isolation:
              <ul>
                <li>Single tenant architecture over a multi-tenant architecture</li>
                <li>Perimeter security over Kerberos &amp; Delegation</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Scaling
              <ul>
                <li>Requirements for scaling applications like Price and Promo</li>
                <li>Requirements for scaling applications like PV</li>
                <li>Intention to use containers (docker/kubernetes)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Versioning
              <ul>
                <li>Multiple services and cost of deployment and the need for automation</li>
                <li>Engineering build to ensure ease of development</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cost Considerations
              <ul>
                <li>Single tenant approach is inherently costlier than multi tenant systems from an infrastructure stand point.</li>
                <li>Containers provide a middle ground to achieve isolation and reusing infrastructure.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
